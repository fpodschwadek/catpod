# Resources

## Software

CATPOD is using [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/introduction.html), an open-source automation software written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). Collections from [Community Namespace](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/index.html) are installed in the Docker image as well.

## Docs

These docs are made with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and use the [Inclusive Sans font by Olivia King](https://www.oliviaking.com/inclusivesans/feature).

## Credits

CATPOD is largely based on work I do for the [Digital Academy at the Academy of Sciences and Literature | Mainz](https://www.adwmainz.de/en/digitalitaet/digitale-akademie.html) and for the [Zeitschrift f√ºr Praktische Philosophie](https://www.praktische-philosophie.org). Thanks to the people involved for letting me tinkering along on weird solutions that surprisingly work (most of the time).
